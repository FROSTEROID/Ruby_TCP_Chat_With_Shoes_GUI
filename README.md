# Ruby_TCP_Chat_With_Shoes_GUI
Yeah, my own TCP chat with GUI and Shoes. No encryption yet though. :\

<To harvest goods, You need a tool; to spread corruption, You need a tool; to send a message, You need a tool>

USAGE:<br>
$shoes Server.rb <br>
$shoes Client.rb 

NOTE:
Yeah, You need to install(unpack and make accessible) Shoes to be able to use this code. Or reinvent Shoes, which way is Yours is not a problem of mine.
Shoes is available there: http://shoesrb.com/
No need installing Ruby along with Shoes as Shoes comes with Ruby being embedded in it.
